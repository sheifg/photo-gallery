## **Photo Gallery** 

### **Project description:**

Design and implement HTML/CSS for the Photo Gallery Website.

The Photo Gallery project is designed to practice and demonstrate the knowledge of CSS units, float, overflow, background image, and shadows. 
The task is to create a web page that displays a photo gallery with images, captions, and navigation controls. 

### **Project objectives:**

1. HTML structure: create an HTML document with a gallery section containing multiple images and captions.
2. CSS units: Use CSS units such as pixels (px) and percentages (%) for defining element sizes and layout.
3. Float: apply the float property to align images side by side within the gallery.
4. Overflow: utilize the overflow property to handle content that overflows the gallery container.
5. Background image: set a background image for the gallery container to enhance the visual appearance.
6. Shadows: add box shadows to images for a three-dimensional effect when hovered over.
7. Navigation: include navigation controls (next and previous buttons) for users to browse through the gallery.
8. Caption styling: style image captions with appropriate fonts, colors, and positioning.
9. Documentation: provide comments in the HTML and CSS code to explain key sections and styles.
